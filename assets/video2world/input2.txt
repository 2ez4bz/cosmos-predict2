In the later moments of the video, the female worker in the front, dressed in a white coat and hairnet, performs a repetitive yet precise task. She scoops golden granular material from a wide jar and steadily pours it into the next empty glass bottle on the conveyor belt. Her hand moves with practiced control as she aligns the scoop over each container, ensuring an even fill. The sequence highlights her focused attention and consistent motion, capturing the shift from preparation to active material handling as the production line advances bottle by bottle.
