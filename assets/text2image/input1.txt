A laundry machine whirs to life, tumbling colorful clothes behind the foggy glass door. Suds begin to form in a frothy dance, clinging to fabric as the drum spins. The gentle thud of shifting clothes creates a steady rhythm, like a heartbeat of the home. Outside the machine, a quiet calm fills the room, anticipation building for the softness and warmth of freshly laundered garments.
