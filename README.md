Cosmos-Predict2 is a key branch of Cosmos World Foundation Models (WFMs) specialized for future state prediction, often referred to as world models. The tree main branches of Cosmos WFMs are [cosmos-predict](https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-predict2), [cosmos-transfer](https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-transfer1), and [cosmos-reason](https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-reason1). We visualize the architecture of Cosmos-Predict2 in the following figure.
