Cosmos-Predict2 is a key branch of Cosmos World Foundation Models (WFMs) specialized for future state prediction, often referred to as world models. The tree main branches of Cosmos WFMs are [cosmos-predict](https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-predict2), [cosmos-transfer](https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-transfer1), and [cosmos-reason](https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-reason1). We visualize the architecture of Cosmos-Predict2 in the following figure.

## Key Features
Cosmos-Predict2 includes the following:

- **Diffusion-based world foundation models** for Text2World and Video2World generation, where a user can generate visual simulation based on text prompts and video prompts.
- **Post-training scripts** for helping Physical AI builders post-train pre-trained Cosmos-Predict2 for their applications.

## Documentation
See below for quickstart installation and usage examples. For comprehensive guidance on run inference and post-training, refer to our []

### Install
Please refer to [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md) for general instructions on environment setup.

  <summary>Install</summary>

### Environment setup

Clone the `cosmos-predict2` source code
```bash
git clone git@github.com:nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-predict2.git
cd cosmos-predict2
```

Cosmos runs only on Linux systems. We have tested the installation with Ubuntu 24.04, 22.04, and 20.04.
Cosmos requires the Python version to be `3.10.x`. Please also make sure you have `conda` installed ([instructions](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)).

#### Inference

The below commands creates the `cosmos-predict2` conda environment and installs the dependencies for inference:

#### Post-training

## Models

Cosmos-Predict2 include the following models

* [Cosmos-Predict2-2B-Text2World](): Text to visual world generation
* [Cosmos-Predict2-14B-Text2World](): Text to visual world generation
* [Cosmos-Predict2-2B-Video2World](): Video + Text based future visual world generation
* [Cosmos-Predict2-14B-Video2World](): Video + Text based future visual world generation
